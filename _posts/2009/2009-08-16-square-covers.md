Over the last year or so, I started collecting album covers and squaring each one for better use in media players like iTunes. The purpose of all this was to build my first web app using Django.

But since always dreams don't manage to become reality, I decided to make [this small collection](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/eb8agh4p25equ9x/l5WNvzNSTS) public. There are over 600 covers right now and sorted by the artist name. I have one small request, if you like Dropbox please use [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTYzMzYyOQ) to register for an account; it gives both of us 250 MB extra space.

My favourite covers, and albums, are Sneaky Sound System's — an Australian & electronic band — because of clever use of patterns and typography.

*After all that being said, he will keep on listening "Dirge" by (life) Death in Vegas.*
