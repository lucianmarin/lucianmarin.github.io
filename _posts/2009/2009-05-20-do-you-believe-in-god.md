Yesterday evening I went to see [Angels & Demons](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/) and I didn’t even sleep since then; coming to write this post in the morning. It’s 5:44 AM and it’s a Wednesday. My thoughts are clear like water, if water can be used as a measure of clarity.

My answer to my own question is “No”. Let me explain myself. My mind can’t understand the term of [God](http://verset.ro/). It just can’t, the term is too big. I can’t draw something on paper when I’m thinking about God. I can’t feel his presence when I’m praying, and I’m pretty sure that even an atheist did pray at least once in his lifetime.

But, I sense an energy when I pick a rock, I hear something profound when I’m in a forest, I feel a vibration when I’m talking to someone else and I know you’re feeling the same. Sometimes it isn’t a good vibration or energy, but it is there. What is [this thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy) that makes all other things connect and the way they are? Can I call it God and be done with it? I think I don’t have other choice for the moment, but one day I hope I will have the chance to find out what it is.

Another thing that I’m thinking of is Universe. I believe is finite, not only in space, but also in time; and it’s not expanding. Actually, this was my first existential question at age of four and it sounded like: “What’s beyond Universe?” (Sorry, Mom). I had an answer right away: “It’s must be finite, it has a margin and beyond it is something black, incomprehensible”. In 9th grade I found a way to demonstrate myself that it was indeed finite; that was when I learned about [mathematical induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction). Probably beyond Universe is [antimatter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter), but who knows exactly…

*After all that being said, he wants to (sleep) dream on. It’s 6:44 AM. Over.*
