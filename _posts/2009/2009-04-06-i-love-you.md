I wanted to make a stop motion movie, but ended up with over 2 minutes of footage filmed on May 11, 2007. Last Sunday I discovered it on a tape. Thinking that I can do something with it, I speed it up 4 times and correct the colors in iMovie '09. All the zooming/blurring effects that you'll see are made with camera itself. Now I will let you enjoy this short clip:

I also want to mention that the clip was on Kontain front page for a day and received lots of views. You can watch it on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/3911393) instead.

*After all that being said, he will try to say the right things at the right time in the (past) future.*
