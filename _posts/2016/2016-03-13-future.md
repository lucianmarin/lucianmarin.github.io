title: The future of the future

The future happens when you take radical decisions. When you say stop and start over. When you say time to move on. When you say you need a change. When you say you want different things. When you want a different job.

#### Engineering

The main problem designers face now is that anyone nowadays can create a design. I noticed this trend a few years ago. I was a pretty good designer for a few years. Then I decided to re-learn programming. I built [Sublevel](https://sublevel.net) and now I have a full-time job as a software engineer. I still think design is better than code, but it’s hard to explain to someone why a design is better than other. With code it’s easier because it does or doesn’t do what the end user is asking. Working as a software engineer is challenging to say the least. If you like puzzles, you’ll enjoy a good coding session. But if you find a puzzle boring, then you need to figure out what’s wrong with the puzzle in the first place. Then you create a loop for yourself to get in and achieve things.

#### 4-inch iPhone

Eight days left until unveils their new 4-inch iPhone. I can’t wait for it to happen. My iPhone 4S is 4 year and half old. It can keep up with the newest software. It fails even at basic thing like book reading. What I want from the new iPhone is a better display with higher contrast ratio just like iPhone 6/6s has. The rest of the phone doesn’t matter because I’ll get used to it. I’m a creature of habit.
