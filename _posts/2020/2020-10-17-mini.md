As an owner of Sonyâ€™s Xperia XZ1 Compact I see the iPhone 12 mini a step in the right direction.

The good stuff:

- iPhone 4S design.
- Size is perfect, just like XZ1C.

Needs to be fixed:

- Cameras aligned vertically.
- Cameras flushed with the back of the iPhone.
- USB-C port.
- TouchID on the power button, just like on XZ1C and iPad Air.
- Hole-punch front camera.
- Wide-angle front camera.
- Bigger battery, at least 2 days.
- Shut down radios from Control Center.

I owned only two smartphones iPhone 4S and Sony XZ1C.
