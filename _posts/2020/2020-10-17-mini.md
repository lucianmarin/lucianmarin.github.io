title: Apple iPhone Mini
---

As an owner of Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact, I see the iPhone 12 mini a step in the right direction.

Mentioning the good stuff:

- iPhone 4S design.
- Size is perfect, just like XZ1 Compact.

What needs to be fixed:

- Cameras aligned vertically.
- Cameras flushed with the back of the iPhone.
- USB-C port.
- TouchID on the power button like on XZ1 Compact and iPad Air.
- Hole-punch front camera.
- Wide-angle front camera.
- Bigger battery to last at least 2 days.
- Being able to shut down radios from Control Center.

I owned only two smartphones: iPhone 4S and Sony XZ1 Compact.
