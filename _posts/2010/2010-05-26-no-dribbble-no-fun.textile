Sometimes you just have to have the ball in order to play. Can I have <a href="http://dribbble.com/" rel="nofollow">some ball</a>, please? Or should I go all over the -place- web for <a href="http://www.pleaseinvitemetodribbble.com/" rel="nofollow">a slam dunk</a>?

*Edit* (Feb 20, 2011): I got <a href="http://dribbble.com/lucianmarin" rel="nofollow">a prospect account</a>. Is there anyone willing to draft me?

*Edit* (Dec 22, 2011): Finally, one year and a half later I got an invite from <a href="http://www.artemlapitski.com/" rel="nofollow">Artem Lapitski</a>. Never say never.
