In the picture below you can see what we call [Romanian Airmen Heroes Memorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_the_Heroes_of_the_Air), located in the Aviators' Square, on Aviatorsâ€™ Boulevard, Bucharest.

This photograph should have been posted five days ago, but somehow I manage to forgot about this draft. Yes, I started writing a new draft for my birthday which, guess what, was also postponed. Now let me explain. [Great Union Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Union_Day) is the national holiday of Romania and it's celebrated on December 1st.

My birthday was five days before this event, enough time to lose track of the things I have to do and care about.
