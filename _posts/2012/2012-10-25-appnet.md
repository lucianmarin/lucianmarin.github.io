Most of us don't want to use our credit cards to pay online, some of us just can't, others prefer PayPal, some think that web should just be free. App.net charges up front if you want use their web application. These two premises don't add up.

Thanks to App.net guys there's a third option. You can still use the web app without creating an account. This is good for people that already have Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr accounts and don't need yet another account to manage on a day by day basis.

The best part about App.net is that they provide a RSS feed for everyone's account. You can grab the RSS from <a href="https://alpha.app.net/marco" rel="nofollow" title="Marco Arment">people</a> you <a href="https://alpha.app.net/gruber" rel="nofollow" title="John Gruber">want</a> to <a href="https://alpha.app.net/garrettmurray" rel="nofollow" title="Garrett Murray">follow</a> and subscribe in your Google Reader account. Basically you end up with a nice timeline of posts. Make sure you add all the feeds in one folder, you don't want the gibberish talk to mess with your tech blogs subscriptions.

*After all that being said, he thinks that people who proclaimed RSS dead were pretty much wrong.*
