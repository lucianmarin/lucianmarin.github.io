When you see her on the subway you think she is the only one that can make you happy. You're far from truth, even her eyes tell you different. It feels like you lost a game that you never could have won. Suddenly, it is wrong to want her. You just have to let it go.

It isn't funny how people think about each other when they see themselves for the first time. Maybe something is wrong with the other one, maybe it isn't, you don't actually know. That feeling is like magic. If it's love, then you know you took a winning lottery ticket. If it's not, you just lose a few seconds of you life — not a very big deal.

And it will happen again…
