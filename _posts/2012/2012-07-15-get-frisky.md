I am a very complicated man, I change my mind every now and then. A few months ago I bought a new domain: friskr.com. The idea was to create a brand new web application where people can upload only black and white photography. The plan was to also build an iPhone app that will let you create dramatic grey scaled photos.

I was pretty sure I can build the entire app myself. I could learn to develop the app with Django and a NoSQL database. I also thought I could deploy the newly created app on an old PC which will run an Ubuntu server. But all this time I got the feeling that this will never happen. Instead, I tried to run a blog where I post interesting black and white photographs just to promote my idea.

This week I changed my mind. I’m thinking the name [Friskr](http://friskr.com/) works better for a modern magazine. What do you think?
