title: An iconic book
---

Back in October last year I received an email from Jon Hicks asking me about the Peculiar icon project. It was a surreal moment for me, since one of my favorite designers was asking me about a project of mine.

After exchanging one or two emails, I understood that he was actually writing a book about iconography. Later the book was finished under the name [the Icon Handbook](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/the-icon-handbook) and included Peculiar as a reference project for CSS icons. I was pretty anxious waiting for the book to be available for purchase.

I think I finally made my father proud. He was working more than 30 years with [movable type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type) and quite liked the icons from the handbook. He even ask me to translate the interview with me.

I'm pretty sure any designer will want to have this book on his desk. I, for one, I'm honored to be included in it.
