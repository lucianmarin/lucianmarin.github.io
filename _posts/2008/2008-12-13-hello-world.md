Some days ago I said to me "hey, let's test Textpattern". And now, this is what I'm doing.

This article should be called "Bye Old World!, Hello New World!", because this is the *n*th time (where *n* can be multiplied by 2) that I start a blog. "Logs" as I called it initialy, should be a replacement to different type of blogs that I had in the past: personal blog on lucmar.com, visual blog on lucianmarin.com, then csstransformer.com and recently, a microblog on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lucianmarin).

When it comes to having a personal blog, I'm always uncertain. The only exception is [EVNO](http://evno.ro/), maybe because is a [Romanian](http://omenesc.ro/) magazine, written in my mother tongue.

*After all that being said, he is not sure what to do, to start fresh or to import some older (articles) posts?*
