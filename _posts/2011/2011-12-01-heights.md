title: Such great heights
---

Today, air planes won’t fall from the sky. Today is [Romania's National Day](http://instagram.com/p/Ww8U5/). The picture was taken at the parade. The push of a button makes you realize that you can save the joy, the excitement, the dreams of all people that are watching the event. Then you go home and feel lonely, insignificant, like nothing ever happen. The only thing you got is the moment you saved, the picture that lives in your mind, a memory that fades away slowly.

There is a saying: you can't see the sky from the trees. What I'm gonna say is that without trees, there will be no sky. Without people, there will be no heights, no expectations from you. You have to climb on the back of other people to reach those heights — there is no other way around.
