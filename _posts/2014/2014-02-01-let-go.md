…was the best day of my life.

I remember the days when I used to be mad about myself for not living up to expectations of other people. I remember the moments that used to give me hope. I remember being good. I remember when other people would look up to me. But I don't remember accepting defeat.

I don't want other people to tell me what to do, what to say, what to think. How to act, how to feel, how to live. Everyone that's imposing their views on others are the worst monsters, self-destroying creatures even if sometimes they think they are the God sent children. Aren't we all are the same at one point? Should that point be crossed every time someone thinks is better? What's *better*?

But I learned to let go. Letting things go feel like taking a breath of fresh air in this over polluted, highly corrupted, modern society. I never wanted to be like anybody else, why should I begin now? Why should I be the same, the regular highly sophisticated citizen of newly globalized world?

We've become what our grand-grand-fathers never wanted for and from us. We steal, we lie, we destroy. We never feel for one another, we never think of one another, we never help one another. Everything is money and everyone has a price. Just…

Let go. It's never too late.
