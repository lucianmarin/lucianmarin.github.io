    <p>Sourcefabric organized a book sprint near Berlin, where an international team wrote a book in just five days. The book is actually a manual for getting started creating templates and using <a href="http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/newscoop/">Newscoop</a> at its full power. Newscoop is a content management system (CMS) specialized for news sites, magazines and mass media publications. Of course, my theme &quot;The Journalist&quot; is already ported to this new CMS.</p>

<h4>The book</h4>

<p>Newscoop 3 Cookbook can already be order from <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?keyWords=Newscoop">Lulu</a> and will be available for free on <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/">FLOSS Manuals</a>. I wrote a full section describing the best practices for designing websites. Here I talked about templates grids, golden ratio, typography, article and comments design for Newscoop. I also wrote a few other sections regarding Facebook, HTML 5 and best practices for SEO.</p>

<p>I designed all the diagrams used in the book. I used a black and white style on a math paper. I tried to simply and clarify every step showed on each diagram. It&#39;s not an easy process as it seems. You have to conceptualize the whole process and then create each step displayed in the diagram. Of course, the team helped me where I got stucked and in the end, I manage to finished them all.</p>

<h4>The team and the place</h4>

<p><strong><img src="/images/cookbook-team.jpg" alt="SoundCloud Workflow Diagrams"></strong></p>

<p>Each member from the team was from a different country. New Zeeland, USA, Romania, Belarus, Serbia, Columbia and Germany were the countries that we originate from. We stayed at <a href="http://www.schloss-neuhausen.de/">Schloss Neuhausen</a> where a few black cats entertained us and blossoming trees put some light on our faces. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s important, but I got the biggest room and I enjoyed each moment spent here.</p>
